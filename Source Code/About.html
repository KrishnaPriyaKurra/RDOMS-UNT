        <h2> Residential Dining Operations Management System at UNT</h2><br>


        <div class="Website_Info">
            <span class="tab"> </span>It goes without saying as to how much food is wasted on a daily basis throughout
            the
            world. Most of this food could be utilized
            fruitfully if proper measures are taken. We have observed the same in the UNT residential dining scenario as
            well. Every semester/year
            a number of students register for meal plans but not all utilize it efficiently. This could be because some
            might feel the dining halls
            are too far away; might be too lazy to go; might be wanting to eat from multiple dining halls at once but
            ultimately end up ordering
            from other restaurants, and the list goes on. Consequently, the dining halls undergo a lot of wastage of
            food
            almost every day.<br><br>


            Our website RDOMS solely to address this issue- is an opertaions management system for UNT Residentail
            Dining
            which allows the
            residential students of UNT, and the managers representing the residential dining halls come together to
            perform
            a wide range of activities.
            On one hand the website has a student interface which allows students to access the menus of UNT residential
            dining services, customize their
            orders from multiple dining halls in a single order and place it for delivery to the students preferred
            dining
            hall. The studnets can check-in
            to the dining halls prior to their arrival, participate in polls and suggest chnages to the existing
            menus.<br><br>
            On the other hand the website also has a manager interface, which allows the managers of the respective
            dining
            halls to plan ahead according to
            the web check-in and a Food Dispersal System to utilize the food efficiently before expiration.<br><br>


            Our approach mainly focuses on the following principle:<br>
            <div class="Quote">
                “Give what the customer wants”.<br>
            </div>
            Ultimately, all these smaller solutions cumulatively help in alleviating the food wastage issue at UNT
            Residential Dining, even if it is just a bit.<br><br><br>
